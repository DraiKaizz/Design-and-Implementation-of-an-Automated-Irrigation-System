**Design and construction of automatic plant irrigation system**

The project uses 16F877A and sensors (LM35, soil moisture, photoresistors) to read the measured value from the environment from which the reading process is sent to the central controller for processing.   
Use the switch-to-switch modes automatically or manually.   
The system mode is active, and the values read from the system will be displayed to the LCD.
